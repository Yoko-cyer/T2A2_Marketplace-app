# Identification of the problems by creating this app 
Recently, the most serious issues in the world now are environmental challenges. These are caused by 7.8 million humans and their activities as supporting industries grow and the population increases. I think we are required to work to maintain a sustainable society and an environment for our next generations. Reducing food wastage is something we can all contribute easily to, so I decided to focus on this problem. Another problem are mental health issues generally, and especially from work stresses in offices, or working/virtually from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. I think sharing some surplus food items or meals, rather than throwing it away into landfill, which will prevent personal isolation and help other people in challenging times. 

## Environment issues
- To reduce Food loss - due to population increase globally 
    - One third of all food produced is lost or wasted. 
    - Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food – costing the global economy close to A$940 billion each year.
    - Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to reduce your carbon footprint, there lessening the impact of global warming and climate change. 
    

- To maintain a Sustainable society  
    - Food rotting in landfill releases methane – 28x stronger than carbon dioxide. 
    - If one quarter of the food currently lost or wasted could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people.
    - 3 in 10 Australians are experiencing food insecurity had not gone hungry before the pandemic. Young people are being hardest hit by the impact of Covid-19.


## Mental health issues 
-  Social isolation has also been linked to serious mental illness, emotional distress, suicides, the development of dementia, premature death, poor health behaviours, smoking, physical inactivity, poor sleep, and biological impacts, including: high blood pressure, and, reduced immune function.

# Task allocation and tracking

I used Trello for my project management. I added some checklists for major tasks for better management. Each card is allocated at an appropriate stage such as To do, Doing and Done.
