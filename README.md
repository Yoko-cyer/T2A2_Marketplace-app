# Identification of the problems by creating this app 
Recently One of the serious issues in the world now is environmental problems. They are caused by a lot of human activities as the industry grows and population increases. I personally took it very seriously after my son was born. I think we are required to work to maintain a sustainable society for our next generations. Reducing food wastage is something we can contribute easily so I decided to focus on this problem. Another problem is mental health issues. I think sharing some food you overcooked or go into the bin for any reason will prevent you from being isolated and help people in their challenged times. 

## Environment problems 
- To reduce Food loss - due to population increase globally 
    - One third of all food produced is lost or wasted. 
    - Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food –costing the global economy close to $940 billion each year.

- To maintain Sustainable society  
    - Food rotting in landfill releases methane – 28x stronger than carbon dioxide. 
    - If one quarter of the food currently lost or wasted could be saved, it would be enough to feed 870 million hungry people.
    - 3 in 10 Australians experiencing food insecurity had not gone hungry before the pandemic. Young people are being hardest hit by the impact of Covid-19.


## Mental health issues 
-  Social isolation has also been linked to mental illness, emotional distress, suicide, the development of dementia, premature death, poor health behaviours, smoking, physical inactivity, poor sleep, and biological effects, including high blood pressure and poorer immune function
